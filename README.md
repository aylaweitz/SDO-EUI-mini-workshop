First, we need to copy this github repository on to your computer. To do this, open your terminal and run the following line:

```
git clone https://github.com/aylaweitz/SDO-EUI-mini-workshop.git
```
** If this doesn't work, you can download the repository as a zip file!

<br>

Move into this repository. Run the following line in your terminal:
```
cd SDO-EUI-mini-workshop
```

<br>

Now let's create a conda environment. This will download all necessary packages to run the tutorial jupyter notebook file. Run the following line in your terminal:

```
conda env create --name SDO_EUI_workshop_env --file=env.yml
```
(This will take a little bit to run)
